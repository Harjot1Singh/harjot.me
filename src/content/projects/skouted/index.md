## Motivation

In the football industry, there are a lot of **talented** **players that get overlooked** by the current scouting system.

The reason they go by **unnoticed** is because there isnâ€™t currently a solid **platform** for players from **grassroots level** **upwards.**

## **Solution**

[Skouted](https://skouted.co.uk) is a **social network** for all **footballers,** from **grassroots** level to **professional** clubs.

Our [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/skouted/id1474856907) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.skouted.app) **app** provides players the best possible chance of being **noticed** by both **scouts and clubs.**
