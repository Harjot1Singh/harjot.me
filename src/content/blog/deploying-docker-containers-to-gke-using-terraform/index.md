So, you've built your platform, you've got some lovely microservices, and now you'd like to deploy your infrastructure with [Terraform](terraform.io).

As an added bonus, you'd love for it to deploy to a development environment when code is pushed to the `develop` branch, and to production when pushed to `master`, as part of a [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) approach.

Let's look at how we can do this, and keep our code [DRY](https://dzone.com/articles/software-design-principles-dry-and-kiss) with [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/). We'll look at deploying the following:

* Google Cloud Project per environment
* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
* Docker images onto Google Kubernetes Engine
* A database provisioned by [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)

We're also going to assume that we'd like to run our development environment in a cheaper (and therefore different) region, and with less nodes in our GKE cluster, so we need to be able to configure some of these parameters on a per-environment basis.

Let's get started. Exemplar code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Harjot1Singh/terraform-example).

### Prerequisites

Install the following to get started.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Google Account
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
* [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/)

### Structure

It's recommended to create a separate folder for all terraform/infrastructure needs at the root of your application. I will unsurprisingly designate this to be named `terraform`.

```bash
mkdir terraform
```

Now we're almost done! (No, do keep reading)

The remaining structure that this example uses is based off [Terragrunt's example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example) and [Jake Morisson's post](https://www.cogini.com/blog/deploying-complex-apps-to-aws-with-terraform-ansible-and-packer/).

We'll create two folders:
- **modules** - Isolated Terraform modules for repeatable instances of infrastructure: databases, services, load balancers.
- **live** - Terragrunt declarations of our actual infrastructure, leveraging the modules we define. Create folders to hold the declarations for any different environments inside:
  - **development**
  - **production**

The `development` and `production` folders will contain sub-directories corresponding to each unit of infrastructure. These folders will call upon any of our `modules` that we define.

An example:
`live/production/gcp-gke` will provide the specific parameters required by `modules/gcp-gke`. This means that we can configure a different `live/development/gcp-gke` unit for our development environment, but only need to change the variables we pass. 

We will place `.hcl` files in the corresponding environment directories, which will contain environment-specific shared variables across the services. E.g. `live/development/google-account.hcl` will contain our development Google Account details.

Terragrunt,

Now we're DRY-ing âœ”.
